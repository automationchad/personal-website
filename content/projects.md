Working with Appen's top product and engineering folks was key. Our goal was clear communication and swift problem-solving.

The situation: Appen was drowning in over a thousand job applications a day. Their current Lever and Salesforce setup was clunky. The mission was to smooth out the data flow between these systems, aiming to build a better Salesforce interface. Their in-house dev team wasnâ€™t up for this specific challenge.

Our approach: We rolled up our sleeves and got to work with a fast, pragmatic style. This project was full of unknowns, only discoverable as we went along. Our flexible, hourly strategy let us adapt and respond to Appen's changing needs.
