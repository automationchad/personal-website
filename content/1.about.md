I'm an engineer, systems manager, and consultant with a focus on sales engineering, backend development, machine learning, AI, and API integration.

My core contribution lies in bridging the gap between technical capabilities and customer needs, creating a seamless interface for software applications. This approach has allowed me to transition into a role where I manage systems engineering, leveraging my expertise to lead development teams and orchestrate projects that align technological solutions with strategic business goals.

My proficiency extends across database management, workflow orchestration, and server architecture, employing platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

This endeavor is a synthesis of methodologies from various domains, applying principles of sales engineering and systems management to solve complex challenges in tech companies and SaaS environments.

I've recently embarked on a self-employed path, establishing myself as a Systems Engineering Manager, and concurrently, I am exploring opportunities to transition back into an in-house role as a Sales Engineer.

This decision stems from a belief in the transformative power of collaborative work environments to drive corporate progress. My consulting experience, rich with insights on team dynamics and strategic problem-solving, has prepared me for executive-level technical pre-sales engagements, where I tackle intricate challenges and high-stakes decisions.

My work is influenced by practical experiences in the tech industry, integrating backend development with machine learning and AI to enhance business operations.

It finds relevance in areas such as enterprise-scale project management, technology solution design, and the development of sales engineering strategies that resonate with both technical teams and executive stakeholders.
