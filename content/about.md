Hello my fellow human being ðŸ‘‹. 

Here's the quick and dirty rundown...

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ 2018 - 2023: Swam across the Pacific to California where I went from a degree in Mechanical Engineering to a tech company sales role, then to orchestrating consulting projects in enterprise integrations, process automation and software development. 

ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º 2024 - beyond: Now back in my hometown Melbourne, I'm looking for an in-house full-time Sales Engineering position. Why? 

1. I value collaborative progress (IMO something you can only get by being internal).

2. I bring holistic experience in leading teams and navigating pre-sales challenges (which requires both tech and communication skills).

3. I understand where AI and automation *should* sit: which is hopefully somewhere between working reliably and aligning with human needs.

Now I'll be honest: I'm not Vitalik Buterin hiding in a cave coding the next Skynet...

... (I know enough Python and Javascript to be dangerous in this crazy age of AI and the internet) ...

But I do have a system designer's mind. 

My approach is practical, focusing on using technical skills to deliver clear business value.

Which means I think procedurally about: (1) What are we building? and (2) How do we join the LEGO pieces together?

... to build something of value. 

I can appreciate what businesses actually need and am realistic about what it takes to get there. 

Eager to contribute to deep tech (combo of hardware and software), and B2B tech (with complex enough deal cycles).

If you appreciate someone technical that also has the gift of the gab...let's connect ðŸ˜„
