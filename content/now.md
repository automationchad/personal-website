I'm looking for a role where I can really use my sales engineering and automation skills. Freelancing has been great for delivering results, but I've learned that being closely involved with a team makes a bigger difference. I want to be part of something where I can contribute more directly.

Also, I'm getting into cybersecurity. With AI, things like deepfakes and ransomware are becoming bigger issues. I'm interested in how we can use both hardware and software to make sure our systems are strong and safe.
